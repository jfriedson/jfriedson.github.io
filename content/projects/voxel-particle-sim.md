## Voxel Particle Simulation

A fully interactive and immense sandbox - up to over 1 million total particles - of water, sand, and stone particles represented as voxels. Physics and ray tracing are processed by OpenGL compute shaders, eliminating the need to transmit large amounts of data between the CPU and GPU.
