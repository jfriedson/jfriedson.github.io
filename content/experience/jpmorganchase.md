## Modernizing Enterprise Web Applications

The Payments division of JPMorgan Chase was tasked with modernizing their infrastructure. My participation in this effort included breaking apart a monolith into microservices, updating Java 8 and app dependencies to modern versions, ensuring the microservices scale efficiently and effectively through rigourous performance and stress testing, performing and validating production deployments, and migrating from a private cloud to AWS.

I learned an incredible amount at JPMorgan Chase, and attained acquiring 3 official certifications for AWS and Kubernetes while working here to prove it.
